### MCB Discord Chatbot ###

This is the code for a simple Discord chatbot that I built for my kids' family gaming server.  

Commands include:

!dadjoke - returns a "dad joke" to the channel via API (icanhazdadjoke.com)
!quote - returns a famous quote to the channel via API (zenquotes.io)
!rock !paper !scissors - simulates a game of Rock Paper Scissors via custom logic

You'll see a few others that my kids added nestled in the main.py file as well.  

Built with Python and the Discord API & hosted via Heroku.
